Estimate the impact of financial crisis on the stocks of banks

As we know or hear about [the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008), the main reason of this financial crisis was due to the US residential housing bubble supported by a huge number of substandard loansâ€”generally with low or no downpayments. In this financial crisis, almost all sectors have been significantly impacted. Except the three biggest French banks, I can also easily find some other big banks in Paris, including Deutsche Bank (DB), HSBC Bank (HSBC), Credit Suisse Bank (CS), and ING Bank (ING). In this project, I will focus on these European banks sector and try to find some regular rules before, during and after the financial crisis in the stock market. This information might be useful for the stockholders and the users of these banks.
